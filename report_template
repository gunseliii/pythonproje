# 📘 Final Project Report

## 🔍 Introduction
This project is a Python-based Word Guessing Game designed with Object-Oriented Programming and a simple GUI using Tkinter. The objective is to guess a hidden word by entering letters. This game offers a friendly interface and is accessible for users with no advanced technical background.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Tkinter
- Visual Studio Code
- Git & GitHub

## 🧠 Implementation Details
- A WordGame class handles the game logic (word selection, guessing, checking win/lose).
- A WordGameGUI class manages the graphical user interface with Tkinter.
- Game state updates dynamically with each guess.
- Restart button resets the game state.

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions
- Basic Tkinter GUI was too plain → Solution: added colorful labels, larger fonts, themed background and buttons.
- Game over logic was not displaying messages → used messagebox to show results clearly.

## ✅ Conclusion & Future Work
We successfully created an interactive and colorful game using Python OOP and GUI libraries. In the future, we could add:
- Score tracking
- Word categories
- Sound effects
- Animation transitions
